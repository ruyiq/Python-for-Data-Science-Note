# Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp
## About This Course
  This is a collection of my notes and solutions to the Python course presented by Jose Portilla, the Head of Data Science at Pierian Data Inc. I took his NLP course first and fell in love with his style of teaching and thus decided to take this course to refresh my knowledge. This course is designed for students with some degree of programming experience but will be suitable for beginners if you intend to work hard for it. Do not hesitate to take it if you're looking for your way becoming a data scientist!
